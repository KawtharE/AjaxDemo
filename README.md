**JQuery** is useful for javascript developers and make a lot of tasks much more simpler.

**AJAX requests** simplify a lot of works when calling APIs, and since there are a lot of free APIs available out there, we can take advantage of theme in our applications. In this demo we are implementing three external APIs:

   -Google Street View API
  
   -New York Times API
  
   -Wikipedia API
  
This demo is responsive and work properly in all devices and we have achieved this by adopting two **Flex pattern**:

   **Layout Shifter Pattern** and **Off Canvas Pattern**

**Note:** when designing a responsive web application, it's the best strategy to design small then go lager means same web application will have a mobile version and a dektop version with no big difference the goal is to make everything look and work properly in all devices.

=>As you can see in the demo, the image retrived from *Google Street View* was displayed as a background on desktop version and at the top the page in the mobile version.
The address related *NYTimes* articles and the *Wikipedia* links are displayed as a lists.
